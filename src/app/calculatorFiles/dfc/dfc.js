        <h1 className="title1">What is DCF?</h1>
        <p className="text">
          Discounted Cash Flow, commonly known as DCF, is a method used to
          analyze whether the investment value is worthwhile based on a
          company's projected future cash flows. In this method, as the name
          suggests, the cash flow is discounted back to its present value to
          give investors a clear idea of its true value.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          This method helps investors make investment decisions and understand
          how much value their investments can generate in the future. It also
          helps the investor to understand the estimated investment to be made
          to earn expected returns.
        </p>

        <h2 className="title">How does DCF work?</h2>
        <p className="text">
          Investment is an important decision, and arriving at one such decision
          can be tedious. DCF, as a formula-based method, helps investors
          estimate the value of returns on their investment in a company based
          on their cash flows.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          The DCF of an enterprise is also called its Net Present Value (NPV).
          This means all future cash flows of the company are discounted back to
          its investment time to arrive at a value.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          If the DCF is higher than the present cost, the investment is
          considered profitable. This means the higher the DCF, the better the
          returns that an investment can generate. If DCF is lower than its
          current cost, then such an investment can be risky.
        </p>

        <h2 className="title">Importance of DCF</h2>
        <p className="text">
          DCF is a prominent technique used in various investment decisions.
          This approach is versatile and is used by various businesses, firms,
          companies, and projects. DCF reflects the necessary information about
          the cash flow to decide on an investment.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          DCF is a formula that is applied to different projects, firms, and
          various types of investments. It also does not rely on peer comparison
          to arrive at the present value of future cash flow.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          DCF can be used in different cases and strategies, such as:
        </p>
        <ul className="list">
          <li>Investment banking for potential mergers or acquisitions</li>
          <li>Real estate and private equity for valuation</li>
          <li>Valuation of stocks, bonds, equipment, and long-term assets</li>
          <li>Business budgeting decisions beyond corporate finance</li>
          <li>Comparing better returns under various investment scenarios</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="title">Formula for DCF</h2>
        <p className="text">
          The calculation of DCF considers the following factors:
        </p>

        <h3 className="heade">1. Cash flow of different periods</h3>
        <p className="text">
          Cash flow means the net cash investors receive on their investments,
          whether in earnings or dividends. Free cash flow is used while
          calculating the discounted cash flow.
        </p>

        <h3 className="heade">2. Number of periods</h3>
        <p className="text">
          The cash flow of different periods is taken into consideration. Most
          of the time, a period of 10 years is used to calculate DCF.
        </p>

        <h3 className="heade">3. Discounted rate</h3>
        <p className="text">
          Discounted rates help in estimating the future cost of the present
          value, often using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).
        </p>

        <h3 className="heade">4. Terminal value</h3>
        <p className="text">
          The terminal value in DCF calculation is the final estimation at the
          end of the formula, indicating the long-term continuation of the
          business.
        </p>

        <h2 className="title">Why use a DCF calculator?</h2>
        <p className="text">
          A DCF calculator helps investors make informed decisions about the
          future value of their present investments. It considers factors like
          free cash flow, growth rates, and the margin of safety.
