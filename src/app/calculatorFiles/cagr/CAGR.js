        <h2 className="title">Understanding CAGR</h2>
        <p className="text">
          Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is a crucial metric used in finance
          to measure the average annual growth rate of an investment over a
          specific period. It accounts for the compounding effect, which means
          that the growth of an investment in one period can contribute to its
          growth in subsequent periods.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          CAGR provides a more accurate representation of an investment's growth
          compared to simple mathematical averages. This is because it considers
          the impact of compounding, where returns on the initial investment are
          reinvested, leading to exponential growth.
        </p>

        <h2 className="title">Key characteristics of CAGR:</h2>
        <ul className="list">
          <li>
            Smooths out volatility: CAGR provides a consistent picture of
            growth, even if the investment's returns fluctuate significantly
            during the period.
          </li>
          <li>
            Accounts for compounding: CAGR captures the power of compounding,
            which can significantly boost returns over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Easily comparable: CAGR allows for easy comparison of the
            performance of different investments, regardless of their initial
            values or time horizons.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="title">How to use a CAGR Calculator</h2>
        <p className="text">
          A CAGR calculator is a simple tool that can help you determine the
          average annual growth rate of an investment. It requires three inputs:
        </p>
        <ul className="list">
          <li>Present Value: The initial amount of the investment.</li>
          <li>
            Future Value: The final amount of the investment after a specific
            period.
          </li>
          <li>
            Time: The number of years between the present value and future
            value.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="title">Formula for CAGR</h2>
        <p className="text">
          CAGR = (Future Value / Present Value)^(1/Time) - 1
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          Once you input these values into the calculator, it will calculate the
          CAGR, expressed as a percentage.
        </p>

        <h2 className="title">Practical Applications of CAGR</h2>
        <p className="text">
