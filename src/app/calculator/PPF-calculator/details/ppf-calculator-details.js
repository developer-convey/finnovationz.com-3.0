                        Before the introduction of the National Pension System (NPS) in 2004, the Public Provident Fund (PPF)
                        reigned supreme as the go-to investment strategy for retirement planning in India. This government-backed
                        scheme offers a compelling blend of safety, tax benefits, and long-term growth, making it a popular choice
                        for individuals seeking a secure and tax-efficient way to build wealth. With a fixed interest rate currently
                        at 7.1%, declared annually by the government, PPF continues to be an attractive option for many investors.
